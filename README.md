# Face Detection with Oval Overlay

This project uses **CameraX**, **Google ML Kit**, and **Jetpack Compose** to implement real-time face detection. The app detects when a face is positioned inside an oval overlay, allowing the user to manually capture a photo.

**Features**

- Real-time Face Detection: Detects faces using Google ML Kit.
- CameraX Integration: Provides a live camera feed.
- Oval Overlay: Guides the user to position their face correctly.
- Photo Capture: The user can take a photo when their face is aligned within the oval.

**How It Works**

1. The app displays a live camera feed with an oval overlay.
2. It detects faces in real-time and checks if the face fits inside the oval.
3. When the face is positioned correctly, the user can manually capture a photo.
